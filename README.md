# eye_protector: Using images to remind you to protect your eyes every 20 minutes.
A simple program to remind you to protect your eyes every 20 minutes.

# Needed package. 
PIL

Please search python install pil on google to install PIL on your computer before moving forward.

# How to use 
- Replace img1.png and img2.png from the imgs folder to your favoriare ones.
- Go to the src folder and run the following 
```python
python eye_protector.py
```
- Bingo! it works. (I know you want to have a quick test first, so I set the short as True by default. When test is done, set short as False then you will be reminded every 20 minutes.)
